# vue-cli-plugin-vuetify alpha
Plugin for vue-cli@3.0

## Install

First generate a project using vue-cli 3.0 [like this](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli).

If you don't want to overwrite your current vue-cli because you still need `vue init`, [then do this](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli/blob/dev/docs/cli.md#pulling-vue-cli2x-templates-legacy).

Before installing the vuetify plugin, make sure to commit or stash your changes in case you need to revert.

To install and invoke the vuetify plugin...
```
npm i -D vue-cli-plugin-vuetify
vue invoke vuetify
```

Now you should see your package.json dependencies updated with vuetify.

This is still a work in progress. Soon you'll be able to scaffold a full project like with `vue init vuetijyjs/webpack`
